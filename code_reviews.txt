Both guidelines want code to be short and neat, and also want both reviewer and
submitter to realize that the review is a discussion and not an insult; both
sides should talk about thinks civil and respectfully.

One difference is that the Yelp guidelines want stuff done very fast ("submit
your code within 24 hours to the reviewer"), whereas Microsoft doesn't seem to
have that as a guideline, just to respect the time of each other. Another difference
is that Microsoft reviews support something called "Emoji Code", while Yelp reviews
have nothing of the sort.

The review here is beneficial because both the poster and the commenters write
with a fairly neutral tone and only discuss benefits that could be made to the code,
or why "x" isn't currently working in the code.

This review is a bad review because both the submitter and what seems to be the
first reviewer are fairly unprofessional with their comments about the code and
what can be adjusted.
